*) assyme Node has two child B and C.
B has two child





Notes:

1) we do not supprt parser stack
2) P4 14 is not fully backward comaptible
3) the bmv is also not backwardnot compatible in all cases
3) reinitializeResourcesForNewPiepeline ei function a action crossbar bitwodth amra 0 te reinitilize korchi eta bodh hoy maximum of existing tables hobe.
because for a ingress pipeline there can be n tables embedded on a stage. but only one will be executed at a time. so for ingress pipeline in worst
the maximum of the action bitwidth will be used. therefore for egress the rest will remain.


Our mapping algorithm
at first maps the mats that useing indirect stateful memories. so we have to explain this in mapping algo and we also have to explain the difference between direct
and indirect stateful memory usage


*) These two function sneed  closer look
self.allocateActionMemoryBitwidth(maxActionMemoryBitwidth) -- are we going to allocate
            self.allocateActionCrossbarBitwidth(maxActionCrossbarBitwidth)




**) How to handle counter and meter

indirect counter and meter support :
in Action class there is a function "getListOfStatefulMemoriesBeingUsed" here we are suporting only register read and write.
if we want to add counter and meter, we need to add suport for both of thm in this function. then it will add indirect counter and meter dependency in the TDG.

Direct meter and counter support:
These are connnected with a specific table entry. so there is no depndency with other table. so basically we do not need anything extra, only
in embedding an action we need to calculate what is their memory requirement and how much memory they do need as part of supporting the action.



*) memory usage optimization:
will look at later part. but only needs to handle two function improvement. the indirect stateful memory allocation and action emmory allocation. These two function needs to
utilize multi word packing to improve memory usage


*) table embedding a direct stateful memory support in action is needed. it should be simple in implementation
