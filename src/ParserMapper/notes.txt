The parser only supports parsing some header and based on some parsed header we can do transition to next state.

1) If the parser_op in a parser state is None but it is a valid transition that means the transition key is a standard metadata field.
Usually this type of lanaguage constructs are not necessary. So we are skipping that. Probably these are supported as part of language specification.

2) In the parser state machine, currently we are supporting only extract operation. For variable leangth header we are not suporting now.

3) Look to the following link
https://github.com/hyojoonkim/p4anony-ontas/blob/master/src/p4anony.p4
This P4 program supports some action as part of the parser. Here you can set some metadata field's value from parsed header vlaue. Currently we do not support
these type of features.

4) If a parser state have two consecutive header parsed/extracted i.e. extract(ethernet); extract(vlan). Our system will not support it.
