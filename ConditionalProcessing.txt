assume a if else pair as follwoing

if (x==3)
  execute table 1
else
  execute table 2

and another code segment
if (x==3)
  h.f = h.x *12
else
  h.f = h.x *13

and another code segment
if (x==3)
  execute table 1
else
  h.f = h.x *13

In first case the result of conditional stores a value to the special field and add that field to table 1 and table 2. This is optimal.
However in case 2 and 3 our mechanism is not optimal. Because for case 2 , we can store that conditional's result into a
special field and based on that special field we can exucute either one of the aciton in case 2. That will be the optimal solution.
Hoever in case 3, it is a mix. we still need 3 table. one for conditional execution and 2 for the true and false branch.
