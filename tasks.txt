the json alre day gives which node come after which one. 

Tasks 
a) builld graph
b) do transitive reduction
b) now build 4 functions that will take input of 2 nodes and check 4 types of depenedcy exists or not  
c) for each header iterate over the actions in ingress nad egress and identify them whther they are ingres and egress. 
then if ingres+egress - common 














2 algo idea:
a) table centric mapping
b) consider everthing as dependency on headre field.and find embedding






1) at first dependency analysis. Dependency analysis kore lavanya jose r algorithm gulo implekent koro
2) tarpore notun 2 ta variation dao. ekta energy aware na arekta energy aware



Assumptions:

1) a stage can execute codditions if a>b x else y



Task list

a) make a function that will run O(n^2) loop to find all kind of dependency. and store them in a map.

c) make a function that will give the list of all the header fields used in a action block. we will use this to find the dependencies

b) then build the graph


d) then process the expressions to expand it into a graph as described in the scratch paper.


e) make a clear cut model of hardware showing instruction memory and action memory. -- urgent


f) make function that will iterate over all the actions and will run n^2 loop tp find which actions have data dependency with other

g) if 2 nodes have data dependency, we will merge 2 nodes and and their depdency. the merged node's predecessor will contain edge to predecessor of both nodes before merging.
this step will be executed after building the graph
