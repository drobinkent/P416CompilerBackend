L.Jose has used 3 metrics for sroting the table in their paper

1) Dependency: Now this is defined by the logical stage levels for the tables. In our system we at first assign appropriate logical stages for the logical MATs.
It implies that, a table with lengthy chain of ligical tables will have higher logical stage level. hence they will be assigned first. So in logical
stage level calculation the sorting is already implemented. therefore for the next two types of metrics we need  to do sorting when we embed the logical MAT according
on the physical stages.

2) Word width:

3) Memory Types:



our variations

a) only table - level -- no specific ordering of the tables in same level
b) prioritize tables with wider match fields.. implies both table level and match weidth is conbsidered
c) then prioritize action width. implies both table level and action weidth is conbsidered. suitable for programs where tables have smaller match width but high action width .



Resources used by an action :

a) header field being modified, being used and their bit width
b) number of stateful memories and their bitwodth
c) we will assume that, the extern also uses the same action crossbar
