1) our scheme can not handle extern
2) if ther is a read modify write then it can not handle in one stage. hence it willl create a loop and such scheme is not supported in our sustem. to handle
this we need to support tnaregister extern.
3) if in same action two stateful memory is accessed then our scheme can not work. we need to fix this in iterativelyPreprocessMATAccessingStatefuleMemmories function
