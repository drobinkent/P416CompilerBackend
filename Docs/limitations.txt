1) Our system can not handle 4 nestted level of header field. For exmaple hdr.p2p_feedback.delay_event_data is okay.
but hdr.p2p_feedback.delay_event_data.new_field is not okay. To support that, you have to add parsing support in PrimitiveField class
of the P416JsonParser.py. Similarly at various places, we have used the values of a primitivefield for dependency checking, you also have to modify them.

2)  Nope this function do not return the list of fields modified in the expression. To do that we need primitive operation wise analysis.
           But in expression used in conditionals we do not need to support fields that are modified. We only support fields that are checked against some value
           If someone wants to support field modification in expression then they have to add this support to the hardware and
           also implement the operator (architectiure specific) nwise analysis-

    so basically our system do not support modification of a field in conditional expression. This is most likely not going to be supported in high speed hardware.
    But we have plan to support that in future
